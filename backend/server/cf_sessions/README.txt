Place your exported Codeforces session cookies here as JSON files.
Each file should be named like: account1.json, account2.json, etc.
You can export cookies from your browser using DevTools > Application > Cookies > codeforces.com > Export as JSON.

Example file content:
[
  {"name": "JSESSIONID", "value": "...", "domain": ".codeforces.com", ...},
  ...
]

The backend will load and rotate these sessions for submissions.
